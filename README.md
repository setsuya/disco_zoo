### About
I like playing Disco Zoo on my phone, but I suck at remembering the pattern for each animal in the game. This tool shows the pattern for each animal and displays the most probable locations on where to find them so I don't waste more tries than necessary on each rescue attempt. It also has an indicator that I can check to know when I rescued the maximum ammount of each animal and help me plan better where to go on each rescue attempt and manage my resources better.
